## 📐 Dedicated Mathematics Research

- **Convolution & Integral Transforms:** Convolution with Gaussian kernels (`e^{-x^2}`) as mathematical cursors, nested Riemann sums, and novel integral transforms for orbit analysis.
- **Curvature-Based Computation:** Treating curvature as an information metric and computational primitive, linking geometric bending with semantic complexity.
- **Operator Theory & Collatz Analysis:** Leveraging operator-theoretic frameworks and fractional iterators to study Collatz orbits and fixed-point dynamics.
- **Fractional & Holomorphic Function Application:** Generalized function iteration as semigroup operators; decomposing real functions into holomorphic scaling and rotation components.
- **Alternative Geometric Representations:** Dot-product-based coordinate systems, boolean matrix curves, and algebraic operator sequences as spatial encodings.
- **Topological Dynamics & Homotopy:** Linear homotopy framed as fractional application, ambient space connectivity, homology preservation under turbulent flows.
